## Laboratory Objective
The purpose of this laboratory assignment was to introduce and build a simple amplitude modulated receiver capable of tuning into AM radio stations in Denver, CO. This was achieved using the GNU Radio Companion software and a NooElec RTL-SDR. Students reinforced concepts such as: Product modulation, resampling, decimation and filtering.
