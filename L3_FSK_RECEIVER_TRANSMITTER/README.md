## Laboratory Objective
In this experiment, students implemented a transceiver and receiver capable of handling frequency shift keying modulation. This involved obtaining the time and frequency plots at various stages of the system and employing signal processing techniques to clean up the signal. Students used GNU Radio Companion and its various modules to effectively modulate and demodulate a digital message.
