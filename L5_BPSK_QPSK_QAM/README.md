## Laboratory Objective
The purpose of this laboratory experiment was to analyze, and compare three modulation/demodulation schemes: Binary Phase Shift Keying, Quadrature Phase Shift Keying, and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation. Each scheme has varying amounts of complexity with each being suited to different amplications. Using the EMONA Telecoms Trainer, students were able to link various modules together to modulate one or more message signals with a carrier, and demodulate and clean-up the output using filters, and comparators. Students also became familiar with the limitations of the hardware. 

## Hardware Requirements
