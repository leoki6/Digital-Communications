## Laboratory Objective
This laboratory involves a variation of the DSBSC modulation scheme called Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum. This scheme involves the using a pulse trainer rather than a sine wave as the carrier, which in essentially made up of bunch of small sinusoids that produce the pulse train. This pulse train is a psuedo-noise sequence. The benefit of this signal is its resistance to jamming since the message contents are spread across so many of these pulses that deliberately trying to jam them is difficult. To be able to capture message information one would need the specific PN sequence and as the sequence get the longer the change of brute forcing it is slow. Thus, in this lab students investigate the DSSS scheme and its use of PN sequences to prevent jamming and encode information using a pulse train instead of a typical sine wave.
