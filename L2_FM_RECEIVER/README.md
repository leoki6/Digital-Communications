## Laboratory Objective
The purpose of this laboratory experiment was to introduce and build a simple FM receiver capable of tuning into local FM sations in Denver, CO. It follows a very similar structure to the previous AM receiver, but has more complex underlying theory and principles particularly with analog FM techniques. Concepts emphasized include bessel functions, instantaneous frequency, and modulation index. This experiment utilized GNU Radio Companion software and a NooElec RTL-SDR to achieve the laboratory objective.

## Hardware Requirements
- NooElec NESDR Smart XTR SDR - Premium RTL-SDR
- Antenna Mast
- Antenna Base & Cable

## Software Requirements
- Windows, Ubuntu, or MacOS
- GNU Radio Companion
